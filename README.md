# NonBlockingModbusMaster
This library is a modification of the Doc Walker's ModbusMaster library.  To access Modbus devices an RS232 to RS485 converter is necessary.

This library's features include:-  
* Completely non-blocking, with suitably sized serial TX and RX buffers  
* Works with any Stream object.   
* Can access multiple device IDs.   
* No callback methods are necessary.   
* Has a retry() method for uses when the command times out (or other error)   
* Has oneTimeDelay() method to insert an extra pre-command delay when switching between ID's   
* Has a simple command chaining facility to group commands together in a single executable block.    
* Supports optional results processing functions called when command completes.   
* Runs on UNO with software serial while maintaining responsive Serial processing.

# Revisions
Version 1.0.1 corrected printHex arg and retry() return.  
Version 1.0.0 initial release. readHoldingRegisters is the only Modbus command fully tested due to lack of other hardware.
